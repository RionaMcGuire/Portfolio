                    <h4>My name is Mike McGuire</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>I'm a happily-married father of four who teaches Computer Science at Mullen High School in Denver, CO.
                        This is my 36th year of classroom teaching, though I've only been teaching programming for the past five years.
                        Prior to that, I've taught high school English and Theology as well as middle school Language Arts and self-contained fifth and sixth grades. 
                        I even taught at a Waldorf school for two-and-a-half years as a PE teacher and then taking over the eighth grade class. </p> 
                    <p>My wife is a school psychologist, our eldest daughter is a middle school English/Drama teacher, our son
                            is a Computer Science major, our next daughter is a high school junior, and our last girl is finishing up eighth grade
                            and heading to Mullen to be our fifth family Mustang.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not teaching or spending time with my family, I switch between passions such as coding,
                        yoga, reading, cycling, chess, a given fitness challege, photography, video games, etc...  In fact, I switch between
                        hobbies so rapidly and unexpectedly that I made this website from scratch in one of my coding moods to keep my
                        family and friends up-to-date regarding which passions I'm into at any given time.</p>
